Developing
----------
You can get started by running 2 programs: `start_backend.sh` and `start_frontend.sh`, both in the root directory.
The output should tell you which port to connect your browser to to get started.

Deployment
----------
Deployment is pretty simple, and supports Ubuntu and sort of supports FreeBSD. See the services directory for more details
